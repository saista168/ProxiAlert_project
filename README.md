# ProxiAlert_project
Arduino-Based Proximity Alert System with WhatsApp Notificatio
This project is a smart proximity alert system that detects objects within a predefined distance using an Arduino sensor and triggers automatic actions on a connected computer. If an object comes closer than 40 cm, the system:

1.Closes the currently active application on the computer.
2.Sends an alert message via WhatsApp to a predefined contact, notifying them of the proximity breach.
